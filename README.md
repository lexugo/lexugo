### 👋 Hey there, I’m [@luxego](https://lexugo.ca)

I'm a full-stack web developer working with Cirque du Soleil! 🌞 
Before that, I was working for Ubisoft Montréal.

#### 🌱 I’m currently working on ...
- [My personal portfolio and business card](https://lexugo.ca) hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/about) showing *in real-time* what song I'm listenning to 🎶
- [A note taking app](https://presense.lexugo.ca) to always stay present 🧘‍♂️ and intentional in the moment backed by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)
- A secret todo app inspired by [Todoist](https://todoist.com/features), [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product) and Kanban that may never see the light of day...
- Some personal [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) librairies to simplify my development process
